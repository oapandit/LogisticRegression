# Logistic Regression

The files contain logistic regression implementation.
Following are few details so as to run the code with ease, though
the file, class, and method names are self-explanatory.

1. It requires scikit-learn implementation which will also install numpy automatically.
2. Model.py contains actual code of logistic regression which can 
be used to create a classifier train it with fit function and get predictions with predict method.
3. Expt.py file contains code to run current experiment and test.py contains all tests written to check logistic regression code.
